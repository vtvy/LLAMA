//var text = "How to Communicate Effectively\r\nNo matter your age, background, or experience, effective communication is a skill you can learn. Some of the greatest leaders of all time are also fantastic communicators and orators. In fact, communications is one of the most popular college degrees today; people recognize the value of a truly efficient communicator. With a little self-confidence and knowledge of the basics, you'll be able to get your point across quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nCreating the Right Environment\r\n1. Choose the right time. As the saying states, there is a time and a place for everything, and communicating is no different.\r\nAvoid starting discussions about heavy topics late in the evening. Few people will be thrilled to be faced with sorting major issues like finances or long range scheduling when they are the most tired. Instead, deliver messages and conduct discussions about heavy topics in the mornings or afternoons when people are alert, available, and more likely to be able to respond with clarity.\r\n\r\n2. Facilitate an open, intimate conversation. Choose the right place, one that provides freedom for the communication to open, flower, and come to maturity. If you need to tell someone something that isn't going to sit well (such as news of a death or a breakup), don't do it in public, around colleagues, or near other people. Be respectful and mindful of the person by communicating to them in a private place. This will also provide space to open the dialog into a wider and a more involved mutual understanding and ensure that the two-way process is functioning properly.\r\nIf you are presenting to a group of people, be sure to check the acoustics beforehand and practice projecting your voice clearly. Use a microphone if needed to ensure that your audience can hear you.\r\n\r\n3. Remove distractions. Turn off all electronics that could interrupt the conversation. If the phone rings, laugh it off the first time, then turn it off immediately and continue talking. Do not allow external distractions to act as crutches that sidetrack your concentration. They will distract both you and your listener, and will effectively kill the communication.\r\n\r\nOrganizing your communications\r\n1. Organize and clarify ideas in your mind. This should be done before you attempt to communicate any ideas. If you are feeling passionate about a topic, your ideas may become garbled if you haven't already targeted some key points to stick to when communicating. Key points will act as anchors, bringing focus and clarity to your communication.\r\nA good rule of thumb is to choose three main points and keep your communication focused on those. That way, if the topic wanders off course, you will be able to return to one or more of these three key points without feeling flustered. Writing the points down, if appropriate, can also help.\r\n\r\n2. Be crystal clear. Make it clear what you're hoping to convey from the outset. For example, your purpose could be to inform others, obtain information, or initiate action. If people know in advance what you expect from the communication, things will go more smoothly.\r\n\r\n3. Stay on topic. Once you start to convey your three main points, make sure everything you're saying adds to the message you intend to communicate and strengthens it. If you have already thought through the issues and distilled the them to the essentials, it is likely that helpful pertinent phrases will stick in your mind. Do not be afraid to use these to underline your points. Even confident, well-known speakers reuse their key lines again and again for emphasis and reinforcement. Remember to keep the overall message clear and direct.\r\n\r\n4. Thank your listener(s). Thank the person or group for the time taken to listen and respond. No matter what the outcome of your communication, even if the response to your talk or discussion has been other than you had hoped, end it politely by properly respecting everyone's input and time.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with Speech\r\n1. Set the listener at ease. You want to do this before launching into your conversation or presentation. It can help sometimes to begin with a favorite anecdote. This helps the listener identify with you as someone who acts like them and has the same everyday concerns.\r\n\r\n2. Be articulate. It is important to deliver your message clearly and unambiguously so that the message comes across in a way that every listener can understand. Your words are remembered because people instantly understand what it is that you are saying. This requires delivering your words distinctly and using simpler words rather than more complex ones.\r\nThe goal of articulate communication is to be clear, concise and relevant.\r\n\r\n3. Enunciate clearly. Speak at a volume level that is guaranteed to be heard and that doesn't come across as too quiet or disengaged. Take special care to properly enunciate key points so that you avoid any kind of misunderstanding. If mumbling is a defensive habit that you have fallen into due to fear of communicating, practice your message at home in front of the mirror. It is sometimes best to discuss what you want to communicate with those you feel comfortable with. This helps solidify the message in your own mind. Be aware that any practice or refinement of your wording will help you to build confidence.\r\n\r\n4. Be attentive when listening and ensure that your facial expressions reflect your interest. Listen actively. Remember that communication is a two-way street and that while you are talking, you are not learning. By actively listening, you will be able to gauge how much of your message is getting through to your listener(s) and whether or not it is being received correctly or needs to be tweaked. If your audience appears to be confused, it is often helpful to ask the listener(s) to reflect back some of what you have said, but in their own words. This can help you to identify and correct mistaken views of what you have intended to communicate.\r\nValidate people's feelings. This will encourage them to open up, and help them feel better if they're upset.\r\n\r\n5. Be vocally interesting. A monotone is not pleasing to the ear, so good communicators use vocal color to enhance communication. Norma Michael recommends[1] that you:\r\nRaise the pitch and volume of your voice when you transition from one topic or point to another.\r\nIncrease your volume and slow the delivery whenever you raise a special point or are summing up.\r\nSpeak briskly, but pause to emphasize keywords when requesting action.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with Body Language\r\n1. Recognize people. Sure, you don't necessarily know the people in your audience or that new friend in your group, but they're nodding along with you and looking knowingly at you all the same. This means that they are connecting with you. So reward them with your acknowledgment!\r\n\r\n2. Be clear and unambiguous with your body language, too. Use facial expressions consciously. Strive to reflect passion and generate listener empathy by using soft, gentle, aware facial expressions. Avoid negative facial expressions, such as frowns or raised eyebrows. What is or isn't negative depends on the context, particularly the cultural context, so be guided by your situation.\r\nBe quick to identify unexpected behavior that suggests a cross-culture collision, such as a clenched fist, a slouched posture, or even silence.[2] If you don't know the culture intimately, ask questions about the communication challenges you might face before you start to speak with (or to) people in an unfamiliar cultural context.\r\n\r\n3. Communicate eye-to-eye. Eye contact builds rapport, helps to convince people that you're trustworthy, and displays interest. During a conversation or presentation, it is important to look into the other person's eyes if possible and maintain contact for a reasonable amount of time. Take care not to overdo it.– Use just as much eye contact as feels natural, about 2-4 seconds at a time.[3]\r\nRemember to take in all of your audience. If you're addressing a boardroom, look every member of the board in the eye. Neglecting any single person can easily be taken as a sign of offense and could lose you business, admission, success, or whatever it is you endeavor to achieve.\r\nIf you're addressing an audience, pause and make eye contact with a member of audience for up to two seconds before breaking away and resuming your talk. This helps individual members of the audience feel personally valued.\r\nBe aware that eye contact is culturally ordained. In some cultures it is considered to be unsettling, or inappropriate. Ask about this in particular or do the research in advance.\r\n\r\n4. Use breathing and pauses to your advantage. There is power in pausing. Simon Reynolds says that pausing causes an audience to lean in and listen. It helps you to emphasize your points and allow the listener time to digest what has been said. It also helps to make your communication come across as more compelling and it makes your speech easier to absorb and become comfortable with.[4]\r\nTake a few deep breaths to steady yourself before you begin communicating.\r\nGet into the habit of solid, regular breathing during a conversation, This will help you to keep a steady, calm voice and will also keep you more relaxed.\r\nUse pauses to take a breather from what you are saying.\r\n\r\n5. Consider how your gestures come across. Use hand gestures carefully. Be conscious of what your hands are saying as you speak. Some hand gestures can be very effective in highlighting your points (open gestures), while others can be distracting or even offensive to some listeners, and tend to shut down the conversation or listening (closed gestures). It also helps to watch other speaker's hand gestures with an eye for how they come across to you. Emulate those you see that are effective and engaging. Notice that the most effective gestures are natural, slow, and emphatic.\r\n\r\n6. Keep a check on your other body signals. Be alert to your wandering eyes, your hands picking at fluff, your constant sniffling, shuffling, rocking, and the like. These small gestures add up and are all guaranteed to dampen the effectiveness of your message.\r\nHave someone record your talk, then take the time to view your speech delivery in fast forward. Any repetitive gesture or unconscious habit will stand out like a sore thumb and will be somewhat comical. Once you have targeted such a behavior, it will be easier to modify your unintended body language and monitor its reappearance.\r\n\r\nCommunicating Effectively When in Conflict\r\n1. Place yourself on even ground. Do not stand or hover over the other person. This creates a power struggle and pushes the conflict to another level. If they are sitting, you should sit with them.\r\n\r\n2. Listen to the other party. Let them say how they feel. Wait until they are completely finished talking before beginning to speak yourself.\r\n\r\n3. Speak in a calm, level voice. Don't yell or make accusations about the other party or their actions.\r\n\r\n4. Let them know you have heard their point and understand their side. Take the time to make statements like, \"If I understand correctly, you are saying,...\"\r\n\r\n5. Don't try to finish the argument at all costs. If the person walks out of the room, don't follow them. Allow them to do so and let them return when they are calmer and ready to talk.\r\n\r\n6. Don't try to get the last word in. Again, this could lead to a power struggle that escalates and never ends. Sometimes, you have to agree to disagree and move on.\r\n\r\n7. Use \"I\" messages. When you're phrasing your concerns, try to start your sentences with \"I...\" and state clearly how their actions make you feel. This will make the other person more receptive to your complaints and more empathetic. For instance, instead of saying \"You're sloppy and it drives me crazy,\" try \"I feel that different levels of messiness might be a problem for us. Clutter is something that seems to work its way into my mind and limit what I feel I can do. Frankly, messiness seems to unsettle me more than it probably should.\"\nAuthor is Vo Trieu Vy";

Instead, deliver messages and conduct discussions about heavy topics in the mornings or afternoons when people are alert, available, and more likely to be able to respond with clarity.\r\n\r\n2. Facilitate an open, intimate conversation. Choose the right place, one that provides freedom for the communication to open, flower, and come to maturity. If you need to tell someone something that isn't going to sit well (such as news of a death or a breakup), don't do it in public, around colleagues, or near other people. Be respectful and mindful of the person by communicating to them in a private place. This will also provide space to open the dialog into a wider and a more involved mutual understanding and ensure that the two-way process is functioning properly.\r\nIf you are presenting to a group of people, be sure to check the acoustics beforehand and practice projecting your voice clearly. Use a microphone if needed to ensure that your audience can hear you.\r\n\r\n3. Remove distractions. Turn off all electronics that could interrupt the conversation. If the phone rings, laugh it off the first time, then turn it off immediately and continue talking. Do not allow external distractions to act as crutches that sidetrack your concentration. They will distract both you and your listener, and will effectively kill the communication.\r\n\r\nOrganizing your communications\r\n1. Organize and clarify ideas in your mind. This should be done before you attempt to communicate any ideas. If you are feeling passionate about a topic, your ideas may become garbled if you haven't already targeted some key points to stick to when communicating. Key points will act as anchors, bringing focus and clarity to your communication.\r\nA good rule of thumb is to choose three main points and keep your communication focused on those. That way, if the topic wanders off course, you will be able to return to one or more of these three key points without feeling flustered. Writing the points down, if appropriate, can also help.\r\n\r\n2. Be crystal clear. Make it clear what you're hoping to convey from the outset. For example, your purpose could be to inform others, obtain information, or initiate action. If people know in advance what you expect from the communication, things will go more smoothly.\r\n\r\n3. Stay on topic. Once you start to convey your three main points, make sure everything you're saying adds to the message you intend to communicate and strengthens it. If you have already thought through the issues and distilled the them to the essentials, it is likely that helpful pertinent phrases will stick in your mind. Do not be afraid to use these to underline your points. Even confident, well-known speakers reuse their key lines again and again for emphasis and reinforcement. Remember to keep the overall message clear and direct.\r\n\r\n4. Thank your listener(s). Thank the person or group for the time taken to listen and respond. No matter what the outcome of your communication, even if the response to your talk or discussion has been other than you had hoped, end it politely by properly respecting everyone's input and time.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with Speech\r\n1. Set the listener at ease. You want to do this before launching into your conversation or presentation. It can help sometimes to begin with a favorite anecdote. This helps the listener identify with you as someone who acts like them and has the same everyday concerns.\r\n\r\n2. Be articulate. It is important to deliver your message clearly and unambiguously so that the message comes across in a way that every listener can understand. Your words are remembered because people instantly understand what it is that you are saying. This requires delivering your words distinctly and using simpler words rather than more complex ones.\r\nThe goal of articulate communication is to be clear, concise and relevant.\r\n\r\n3. Enunciate clearly. Speak at a volume level that is guaranteed to be heard and that doesn't come across as too quiet or disengaged. Take special care to properly enunciate key points so that you avoid any kind of misunderstanding. If mumbling is a defensive habit that you have fallen into due to fear of communicating, practice your message at home in front of the mirror. It is sometimes best to discuss what you want to communicate with those you feel comfortable with. This helps solidify the message in your own mind. Be aware that any practice or refinement of your wording will help you to build confidence.\r\n\r\n4. Be attentive when listening and ensure that your facial expressions reflect your interest. Listen actively. Remember that communication is a two-way street and that while you are talking, you are not learning. By actively listening, you will be able to gauge how much of your message is getting through to your listener(s) and whether or not it is being received correctly or needs to be tweaked. If your audience appears to be confused, it is often helpful to ask the listener(s) to reflect back some of what you have said, but in their own words. This can help you to identify and correct mistaken views of what you have intended to communicate.\r\nValidate people's feelings. This will encourage them to open up, and help them feel better if they're upset.\r\n\r\n5. Be vocally interesting. A monotone is not pleasing to the ear, so good communicators use vocal color to enhance communication. Norma Michael recommends[1] that you:\r\nRaise the pitch and volume of your voice when you transition from one topic or point to another.\r\nIncrease your volume and slow the delivery whenever you raise a special point or are summing up.\r\nSpeak briskly, but pause to emphasize keywords when requesting action.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with Body Language\r\n1. Recognize people. Sure, you don't necessarily know the people in your audience or that new friend in your group, but they're nodding along with you and looking knowingly at you all the same. This means that they are connecting with you. So reward them with your acknowledgment!\r\n\r\n2. Be clear and unambiguous with your body language, too. Use facial expressions consciously. Strive to reflect passion and generate listener empathy by using soft, gentle, aware facial expressions. Avoid negative facial expressions, such as frowns or raised eyebrows. What is or isn't negative depends on the context, particularly the cultural context, so be guided by your situation.\r\nBe quick to identify unexpected behavior that suggests a cross-culture collision, such as a clenched fist, a slouched posture, or even silence.[2] If you don't know the culture intimately, ask questions about the communication challenges you might face before you start to speak with (or to) people in an unfamiliar cultural context.\r\n\r\n3. Communicate eye-to-eye. Eye contact builds rapport, helps to convince people that you're trustworthy, and displays interest. During a conversation or presentation, it is important to look into the other person's eyes if possible and maintain contact for a reasonable amount of time. Take care not to overdo it.– Use just as much eye contact as feels natural, about 2-4 seconds at a time.[3]\r\nRemember to take in all of your audience. If you're addressing a boardroom, look every member of the board in the eye. Neglecting any single person can easily be taken as a sign of offense and could lose you business, admission, success, or whatever it is you endeavor to achieve.\r\nIf you're addressing an audience, pause and make eye contact with a member of audience for up to two seconds before breaking away and resuming your talk. This helps individual members of the audience feel personally valued.\r\nBe aware that eye contact is culturally ordained. In some cultures it is considered to be unsettling, or inappropriate. Ask about this in particular or do the research in advance.\r\n\r\n4. Use breathing and pauses to your advantage. There is power in pausing. Simon Reynolds says that pausing causes an audience to lean in and listen. It helps you to emphasize your points and allow the listener time to digest what has been said. It also helps to make your communication come across as more compelling and it makes your speech easier to absorb and become comfortable with.[4]\r\nTake a few deep breaths to steady yourself before you begin communicating.\r\nGet into the habit of solid, regular breathing during a conversation, This will help you to keep a steady, calm voice and will also keep you more relaxed.\r\nUse pauses to take a breather from what you are saying.\r\n\r\n5. Consider how your gestures come across. Use hand gestures carefully. Be conscious of what your hands are saying as you speak. Some hand gestures can be very effective in highlighting your points (open gestures), while others can be distracting or even offensive to some listeners, and tend to shut down the conversation or listening (closed gestures). It also helps to watch other speaker's hand gestures with an eye for how they come across to you. Emulate those you see that are effective and engaging. Notice that the most effective gestures are natural, slow, and emphatic.\r\n\r\n6. Keep a check on your other body signals. Be alert to your wandering eyes, your hands picking at fluff, your constant sniffling, shuffling, rocking, and the like. These small gestures add up and are all guaranteed to dampen the effectiveness of your message.\r\nHave someone record your talk, then take the time to view your speech delivery in fast forward. Any repetitive gesture or unconscious habit will stand out like a sore thumb and will be somewhat comical. Once you have targeted such a behavior, it will be easier to modify your unintended body language and monitor its reappearance.\r\n\r\nCommunicating Effectively When in Conflict\r\n1. Place yourself on even ground. Do not stand or hover over the other person. This creates a power struggle and pushes the conflict to another level. If they are sitting, you should sit with them.\r\n\r\n2. Listen to the other party. Let them say how they feel. Wait until they are completely finished talking before beginning to speak yourself.\r\n\r\n3. Speak in a calm, level voice. Don't yell or make accusations about the other party or their actions.\r\n\r\n4. Let them know you have heard their point and understand their side. Take the time to make statements like, \"If I understand correctly, you are saying,...\"\r\n\r\n5. Don't try to finish the argument at all costs. If the person walks out of the room, don't follow them. Allow them to do so and let them return when they are calmer and ready to talk.\r\n\r\n6. Don't try to get the last word in. Again, this could lead to a power struggle that escalates and never ends. Sometimes, you have to agree to disagree and move on.\r\n\r\n7. Use \"I\" messages. When you're phrasing your concerns, try to start your sentences with \"I...\" and state clearly how their actions make you feel. This will make the other person more receptive to your complaints and more empathetic. For instance, instead of saying \"You're sloppy and it drives me crazy,\" try \"I feel that different levels of messiness might be a problem for us. Clutter is something that seems to work its way into my mind and limit what I feel I can do. Frankly, messiness seems to unsettle me more than it probably should.\"\nAuthor is Vo Trieu Vy");

    Article: How to Tell if Gold Is Real
    Content: Drop the gold into a jug of water to see if it sinks. Get a container big enough to hold both the water and the gold you’d like to test. The water temperature you use doesn’t really matter, so lukewarm water is fine. Real gold is a dense metal, so it falls directly to the bottom of the jug. Imitation gold is much lighter and floats.
    Real gold also doesn’t rust or tarnish when wet, so if you see a discoloration, you probably have plated gold. Put a few drops of vinegar on the gold. Set your jewelry or gold piece onto a flat surface. Use an eyedropper to apply a bit of vinegar and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Real gold won’t change color, but fake gold will.
    You can also submerge the gold in a glass container with vinegar for 15 minutes. This is a slightly riskier method because vinegar might damage semi-precious stones on gold jewelry. Find any noticeable discolorations where the gold has worn away. Gold is pretty soft for a metal, so plated gold often rubs away over time. The best places to check are around the edges of jewelry and coins. These spots often rub up against your skin and clothing throughout the day. If you see a different metal underneath the gold, you know your item is plated and not considered real gold.
    For example, a silver coloring might indicate silver or titanium. A red coloring could mean copper or brass. Note any discolorations on your skin from wearing or holding the gold. Pure gold doesn’t react with sweat or oil from your skin, so if you see black or green marks, they are from other metals. Silver leaves behind black marks and copper leaves behind green marks. If you see a lot of these marks on your skin, your gold may be less pure than you expect.
    Keep in mind that most gold items are blends of gold and other metals. Even something like a 14K piece of jewelry, 58.3% gold, can leave these marks. Use other tests as well to ensure your gold is authentic. Hold a strong magnet up to see if the gold sticks to it. For this test, you need a strong magnet capable of pulling even metal blends. Move the magnet over the gold and observe how it reacts. Gold isn’t magnetic, so don’t be fooled by anything that sticks. If the magnet pulls the gold toward it, your item is either impure or a fake.

    Regular kitchen magnets might not be strong enough. For better accuracy, buy a powerful neodymium magnet from a home improvement store.
    The magnet test isn’t foolproof, since counterfeit gold can be made with non-magnetic metal like stainless steel. Also, some genuine gold items are made with magnetic metals such as iron. Rub the gold on unglazed ceramic to see if it leaves a streak. Make sure you’re using an unglazed piece of ceramic since anything with a glaze could affect the test results. Drag your item across the plate until you see some fragments coming off the gold. If you see a black streak, that means your gold is not real. A gold streak usually indicates authentic gold.

    Try getting an unglazed ceramic tile or a plate online or from your local home improvement store.
    This test scratches the gold a little bit but doesn’t typically leave much noticeable damage. It is much safer than other tests involving scratches or acid.
    Another way to do this is by spreading some cosmetic foundation on your skin and dragging the gold across it after it dries. Fake gold usually reacts with the foundation, leaving a green or black streak in it. Look for an official number marking on the gold. The marking, or hallmark, tells you the percentage of gold in an item. The hallmark is often printed on jewelry clasps or the inner bands of rings. It is usually visible on the surface of coins and bullion. The stamp is a number from 1 to 999 or 0K to 24K depending on what kind of grading system was used.

    Use a magnifying glass to help you identify the hallmark. It can be tough to make out by eye, especially on smaller pieces of gold such as rings.
    Older pieces of jewelry may not have visible hallmarks. Sometimes the hallmark wears off over time, while in other cases the jewelry never got a stamp. Hallmarking became common in the 1950s in some areas, but in India for instance, it only became mandatory in the year 2000. Use the number marking to determine how much gold is in your piece. Most coins and jewelry are not pure gold, so they have other metals mixed in. There are 2 different scales used to indicate this through the hallmark. The number rating system used in Europe runs from 1 to 999 with 999 meaning pure gold. The U.S. uses a scale from 0 to 24K, where 24K is pure gold.

    The number rating system is easier to read than the karat rating system. For example, a rating of 375 means your item consists of 37.5% gold.
    What number means gold depends on the country you are in. In the U.S., for example, anything 9K and under is not considered to be gold, even though a 9K bracelet consists of 37.5% gold.
    Counterfeit pieces may have markings making them look authentic, so don’t go solely on the hallmark unless you’re certain you are holding gold. Check for a letter marking indicating that the gold isn’t pure. Some of the common letters you may see are GP, GF, and GEP. These letters indicate that your gold piece is plated, which means the maker put a thin layer of gold over another metal, such as copper or silver. Your item has some gold in it, but it isn’t considered real gold.

    GP stands for gold plated, GF means gold filled, and GEP means gold electroplate.
    The markings vary a little depending on where the gold is from. For instance, gold from India contains a small triangle symbol indicating the government council responsible for the rating system. It then has a number rating and a letter code, such as K, for the jeweler. Weigh your piece of gold on a scale. If you have a decent kitchen scale, place the gold on it. Otherwise, jewelers and appraisers often can do it for you for free. Call around to different jewelry or appraisal stores to see which ones offer this service. Make sure you get the weight in grams rather than ounces.
    You need the weight in grams to use in a calculation later. If the weight is in ounces, you won’t get an accurate result. Fill a graduated cylinder halfway full with water. Choose a cylinder that is big enough to hold the gold. It needs to have measurement markings in milliliters (mL) or cubic centimeters (cc). If you don’t have a regular graduated cylinder, you could try using a kitchen measuring cup.

    Vials with frequent millimeter markings on the side are useful for getting a more accurate measurement during the test.
    The amount of water you use doesn’t matter that much as long as you leave plenty of space for the gold. If you fill the vial to the top, dropping the gold into it causes the water to spill. Read the starting water level in the cylinder. Look at the markings on the cylinder, then record the water level. This measurement is very important for the test, so write it down. Make sure you have the vial on a flat, level surface in order to get as accurate a reading as possible.
    Keep in mind that it doesn’t matter if your vial is marked in milliliters or cubic centimeters. They are the same measurement, so either unit can be used in the test. Drop the gold into the vial and record the new water level. Gently lower the gold into the cylinder to avoid losing any of the water. Let go of it right above the water to prevent splashing or getting your fingers wet. Then, read the markings again to get the second measurement.
    Write the second measurement down on a piece of paper. Note that this is the second measurement, not the initial one. Subtract the measurements to find the difference in the water level. To figure out how much water the gold displaced, subtract the initial measurement (the smaller number) from the final measurement. This gives you an answer in milliliters or cubic centimeters, depending on what measurement your vial lists.
    For example, if you started with 17 mL (0.57  fl oz) of water that rose to 18 mL (0.61  fl oz), that leaves a 1 mL (0.034  fl oz) difference. Divide the gold’s weight by the difference in the water level. The density of the gold equals its mass divided by its volume. After calculating the density, compare the result to the standard density of gold, which is 19.3 g/mL. If your number is way off, chances are you have a fake. Keep in mind, though, that some combinations of metals in fake gold can have a density similar to real gold.

    For instance, you have a gold item that weighs 38 g (1.3 oz) and displaces 2 mL (0.068  fl oz) of water. Divide 38 by 2 to get 19 g/mL, which is very close to the density of gold.
    The standard density differs a little depending on the type of gold you have. For 14k yellow gold, it’s about 12.9 to 13.6 g/mL. For 14K white gold, it’s around 14 g/mL.
    A piece of 18K yellow gold has an average density from 15.2 to 15.9 g/mL. A piece of 18K white gold has a density from 14.7 to 16.9 g/mL.
    Any 22K piece of gold has a density around 17.7 to 17.8 g/mL. Purchase a gold-testing kit to get the acid you need for the test. Testing kits include various bottles of nitric acid for different types of gold. Some tests also include a flat rock called a touchstone you can use to scratch off some of the gold on your item. You may also see needles with samples of yellow and white gold to use as a comparison to your item.
    Testing kits are available online. Also, check with local jewelry stores. Most jewelers use this test for its accuracy. Create a small scratch on the gold using a sharp tool. Choose an inconspicuous location on the jewelry to make the scratch, such as underneath a clasp or an inner band. Then, use a sharp tool such as a jewelry engraver to dig into the gold. Scratch until you get underneath the top layer of gold. Expose a fresh layer of gold or any other metal underneath it.
    Nitric acid tests require you to scratch your piece of gold. If the gold has personal value to you or you plan on keeping it, take it to a professional jeweler instead of doing the test yourself. Add a drop of nitric acid to the scratch. Put on latex gloves and work in a well-ventilated room to avoid any issues with the dangerous acid. When you’re ready, look for the bottle of acid labeled for 18K gold. After setting the gold in a stainless steel container, place a drop of the acid directly on the scratch you made, then watch for it to turn a shade of green. If it turns green, you know right away your gold is fake.

    Regular gold does not react to the acid, so your item might be gold plated or a low-purity blend of metals.
    A milk-colored reaction usually indicates gold-plated sterling silver. If the acid turns gold, you have gold-plated brass. Scratch the gold on a touchstone to test its purity. If you think you might have real gold, rub it along the touchstone to create a streak of gold flakes. Add a drop of 12K, 14K, 18K, and 22K nitric acid to different parts of the streak. Check back after 20 to 40 seconds. Find the spot where the acid doesn’t dissolve the gold to figure out what karat rating your item is.
    The acids all increase in strength, so the acid used for 22K is stronger than the 12K one. If the 18K acid dissolves the gold but the 14K one doesn’t, you know your item is probably around 14K.

    //Article: How to Swim
    //Content: Let go of your fear.  A lot of people put off learning how to swim because they're afraid of drowning. While drownings do occur, most of them could have been prevented by simple safety measures.  Follow these guidelines whenever you're swimming, and the odds of drowning will decrease dramatically:

    //Don't swim alone. Always go swimming with one other person who is a strong swimmer, if not several other people. An area with a lifeguard is usually the best place to swim.
    //Don't start out swimming in moving water.  If you're learning to swim in an ocean or river, you'll need to be more aware of the motion of the water.  If you must learn to swim this way, try to make sure you're with someone who knows what he or she is doing, and be sure to read the step about getting out of a riptide or a rushing river (below).
    //Use proper safety gear until you have enough water experience and are reasonably comfortable in the water.
    //Stay within a depth you can handle.  When you're first learning how to swim, don't venture into water that's too deep for you to stand in.  That way, if something goes amiss, you can simply stand up and breathe.
    //Avoid swimming during inclement weather conditions. Swimming in a light rain shower should be fine, but if you see or hear a storm approaching, get out of the water immediately. This rule is to be followed regardless of how well you can swim.
    //Don't swim in water that's too cold.  Moving your limbs to paddle can become suddenly difficult if you're in frigid water. Get used to floating.  When you're in the water, hold on to the side of the pool or a dock, and let your legs float out behind you - they should lift easily if you let them. But, for some people, they like to sink to the bottom, while your upper body floats. Don't worry; just retry the method again. Practice doing this on your stomach and on your back, until you're used to letting half of your body float.
    //Try floating on your back or your stomach as soon as you're ready.  Stay in a shallow depth so that you can simply stand up if it's not working out.  It might feel weird to have water around your ears while your nose and mouth are in the air, but you'll get used to it.  For extra stability, put out your arms at a right angle so that your body is in a "T" shape. When floating for the first time, you can try taking a deep breath and then floating. If your lungs are full of air, your body will float for sure. Do this until you're more experienced. Don't panic. Always remember that you have a fallback if you're in an unmanageable depth or you simply can't move your limbs - floating on your back.  Don't flail around or start breathing quickly if you can't swim; simply lie back as flat as you can, and let the water carry you while you regain your composure. 
    //A good tip for floating on your back is to hold your breath and have lungs full of air. Another good tip is to stick your stomach out. Practice exhaling underwater.  While you're still in a shallow depth, take a deep breath and put your face underwater.  Slowly exhale out your nose until you're out of breath, then come back up. Bubbles should come out. You can also exhale out of your mouth, but usually in big bubbles until you finally let out a stream of bubbles.
    //If you're uncomfortable exhaling through your nose, you can hold it closed or wear a nose plug and exhale through your mouth. Wear goggles (optional).  Wearing goggles can help you feel more comfortable opening your eyes underwater, and might allow you to see more clearly.  Find a pair with spongy circles around the eyes and dip them in the water, so that they'll stick to your skin.  Tighten the strap around the back of your head so that the goggles fit snugly. Practice kicking your legs.  Whether you're floating on your back or still holding on to the side of the pool, you can practice kicking.  (To see how far each kick can propel you, practice it using a kickboard.  This allows you to focus on your kicking technique without worrying about keeping your head above water.)

    //Try a flutter kick.  Point your toes out like a ballerina, keep your legs mostly straight, and alternate legs as you make small kicks.  You should feel the most flexion in your ankles.
    //Try a whip kick.  Keep your legs held tightly together from your hips to your knees, and from your knees to your ankles.  Bend your knees so that your shins come up to about a 90-degree angle, then quickly bring your shins apart and move them in a circular motion, keeping your thighs together the whole time.  (That is, trace half a circle with each leg, moving your right leg to the right and your left leg to the left.)  Bring your shins back together at the bottom of the circle, and lift them up again to restart the kick.
    //Try an eggbeater kick.  This kick is commonly used to tread water, and stay in a vertical position with your head and shoulders above water.  Start with your knees bent and your legs slightly wider than hip-width apart.  Then "pedal" each leg as you would on a bike, only they'll go in opposite directions: while one leg pedals "forward," the other leg should pedal "backward."  This one takes some practice to get used to, but it's handy for "resting" when your feet can't touch bottom. Learn how to do a crawl.  Crawls are great strokes to learn as a beginner, and they'll move you pretty quickly.  Here's how to do them:

    //Try a backstroke first.  Float flat on your back, and do a flutter kick with your legs.  With your arms, do the "crawl" motion, lifting one arm straight into the air and keeping it straight as it re-enters the water next to your head.  Once it's underwater, bend it to bring it back to a straight position next to your side, and repeat.  Alternate arms as you swim, and try to keep your fingers together and your hands as flat as possible.
    //Try a front stroke (also known as a freestyle or American crawl).  Floating on your stomach, do a flutter kick with your legs and use your arms to "crawl" forward.  Bring one arm out of the water so that it's "reaching" forward, then bring it back down and use your cupped hand to "push" the water behind you.  Alternate arms.  To breathe, turn your head to one side under the arm that's currently crawling, lifting enough for you to take a breath.  Take a breath under the same arm each time, so that you're breathing once every two strokes. Tread water.  Treading water can help you catch your breath and keep your head up without actually swimming.  Do the eggbeater kick listed above, and use your hands to keep your balance by "sculling" - keep your forearms flat on the surface of the water, and imagine they're butter knives spreading on a piece of toast.  Move one arm in a clockwise circle, and the other arm in a counterclockwise circle. Use your arms to come up from the bottom. If you're below water and would like to come up, use your arms to propel yourself. Put them straight up above your head, and quickly bring them down to your sides. This should push you up a few feet. Repeat until you break the surface. Try some more advanced strokes.  Once you're more comfortable in the water, you can start learning new strokes that will move you more quickly or with less energy.  Try these:

    //Learn the dolphin stroke.
    //The butterfly stroke .
    //Swim the breaststroke.
    //Do the sidestroke.
    //Try swimming laps. Try diving.  Dives can be a fun way to get into the water and start a stroke.  Start with a basic dive, and move on to more complicated swan dive, back dive, and rolling dive.

    //Always make sure the water is deep enough before you dive.  At a bare minimum, the water should be 9 or 10 feet (2.7 or 3.0 m) deep; if you're a tall person, make it at least 11 or 12 feet (3.4 or 3.7 m). Know how to get out of a rip current. If you're swimming in the ocean, you might get caught in a rip current.  Knowing what to do can save your life, so try to memorize these steps before you get into the water.

    //Do not panic. This is, by far, the most important step of all.  By flailing and panicking, you could actually keep yourself under the water.
    //Swim sideways.  Do not try to swim directly to shore or directly out further into the ocean.  Instead, try to swim in a line that's exactly parallel to the shoreline.
    //Swim in a stroke that allows you to breathe.  Swim with the strongest stroke you can do that also allows you plenty of room to breathe.  This might be a sidestroke, front crawl, or breaststroke.
    //Keep swimming until you're out of the rip current.  You might have to swim quite far before you're safely out of the rip current, but keep going.  You don't want to undo the good work you've done so far by heading for shore at the wrong time.
    //If possible call out for help.  If you can, motion to the lifeguard or yell "Help!" as soon as possible.  However, don't do this if it means sacrificing a breath or if you have to stop swimming - it's better to keep yourself moving. Know how to get out of a river current.  If you're caught in a river that's flowing too quickly or pushing you under, follow these steps to get out:

    //Don't flail or panic.  As with a rip current, panicking and flailing your limbs can push you deeper into the water.  Try to take even breaths and remain calm.
    //Aim to swim diagonally toward the shoreline.  Swimming toward the shoreline at a 90-degree angle will force you to fight with the current too much, and might cause you to become exhausted quickly.  Instead, plan to get to the shoreline at a diagonal angle that goes with the current.
    //Don't try to swim upstream.  You'll spend too much energy for not enough results.  Only try to swim upstream if there's immediate danger downstream, such as sharp rocks or a waterfall.
    //If you are being rapidly carried downstream by the current, point your feet in the direction you are being carried. This may prevent you from striking your head on a rock or other obstruction.

    //Article: How to Learn English
    //Content: Go to an English class. Another great way to put some more English conversation into your week is to go to an English class.
    //Going to an English class is a great way to focus on some of the more formal parts of speaking English. A class will teach you the grammatically correct way of speaking -- which has proper sentence structure and verb conjugation and will provide a very organized way to learn English. Study English Phonology. Phonology deals with English pronunciation. In English we don't say what we write. Every word has a phonetic form. Some dictionaries have the phonetic form of a word and the word.You can search online for Phonology videos.

    //Find online dictionaries for pronunciation.
    //In Informal English the letter "g" at the end of suffix "ing" is not pronounced. So you will hear the word "talking" as "talkin". When "th" is preceded by the consonant, the letter "n" is pronounced from the "th" tongue position. The phrase "in the"will be heard as "inna". When 't' is between two vowels "t" is pronounced as flap "t" which is heard as "d". The word "letter" is heard as "ledder". Speak English every day. The absolute best way to learn any language is to use it. It doesn't matter if you only know five English words or if you're almost fluent -- speaking English with another person is the best way to improve.

    //Don't wait until you "feel more comfortable" speaking English -- you won't get there for a long time, so start speaking English today. You'll be amazed at how quickly your English improves.
    //Find a native English speaker to talk with.
    //If you live in an English-speaking country, you can practice by starting simple conversations with the people you meet, whether it's saying "hello" or asking someone for directions. Improve your pronunciation. Even if you are good at English, with good grammar and a large vocabulary, native English speakers may have trouble understanding you if your pronunciation is not correct.

    //Correct pronunciation is needed if you want to improve your English. Listen carefully to how native English speakers pronounce words and sounds and do your best to copy them.
    //Pay attention to any sounds that you don't know. For example, some people have trouble pronouncing the "r" sound, as it does not exist in their native language, while other people have difficulty with some consonant combinations, such as the "th" sound.
    //Be aware that the pronunciation of English words varies a lot  depending on where it's spoken. For example, American English is very different from British English. If you want to travel to or live in an English-speaking country, this is something you should consider when learning how to pronounce words. Expand your vocabulary and use idioms. The larger your vocabulary and the more English phrases you learn, the easier speaking English will become.

    //Again, spending time with native English speakers will help you learn common vocabulary and phrases naturally. Although reading, watching English TV and listening to the news is also helpful.
    //Once you learn a new word or phrase, you should use it in a sentence -- this is the best way to memorize it.
    //Another way to memorize words is to make labels for everyday household items and attach them to those everyday items. Then every time you use the kettle or look in the mirror, you will see the English word for these items.
    //You should also start a notebook of idioms that English speakers use all the time. Some examples include "it's raining cats and dogs" (raining heavily), to be on "cloud nine" (to be very happy) or saying something is a "piece of cake" (when something is very easy). Using these idioms in your conversation will help you improve your English. Have a dictionary. Having an English dictionary (whether it's an actual dictionary or a digital one) can be very useful.

    //Having a dictionary means that you will be able to understand conversations in English and have conversations in English.
    //Having an English dictionary will help you memorize English words.
    //If you don't want to buy a dictionary٫ you can use an online dictionary or install a dictionary app on your phone or tablet. Listen to radio or podcasts in English. One of the best ways to improve your English is to download podcasts or radio apps in English on your phone or MP3 player.

    //You should then try to listen to podcasts or radio shows for at least 30 minutes per day. Do it in the gym, on your way to work, or while you're sitting at your computer.
    //Try to understand what's being said, don't just listen to it. Even if it is too fast, try to listen for keywords and phrases to get an idea of what the conversation is about.
    //If you can, make a note of any words or phrases that you don't understand and look up the translation afterwards. Then listen to the podcast or show again to hear the new words or phrases in context. Watch movies and TV shows in English. Another fun way to improve your English is to watch movies and TV shows in English.

    //Try to pick movies or TV shows that you will enjoy -- this will make it more fun, which will help you actually learn English.
    //However, you should avoid watching movies or television shows with subtitles in your native language -- they will only distract you and you will be less likely to learn English from it. Read a book, newspaper or magazine in English. Reading is a great way to improve your English. 

    //Find something you like -- whether that's a famous English novel, The New York Times or a fashion magazine and read it. If it is boring, you won’t learn from it.
    //Again, try to actually understand what you're reading, don't just read it. Highlight any words or phrases that you don't know, then look them up in the dictionary.
    //If you're all alone, you could also try reading out loud. Keep a diary in English. Aside from reading and listening in English, you should also spend some time improving your written English skills.

    //This may be one of the most hard parts of learning English, but it is still important. Writing in English will help you to work on your sentence structure, grammar and spelling.
    //Try keeping an English diary where you write down a few sentences every day. It doesn't have to be personal -- you could write about the weather, what you ate for dinner or what your plans are for the day.
    //If you feel comfortable with it, get a native speaker to read what you've written and check it for any mistakes. This will help you to avoid making the same mistakes over and over again. Find a native English speaker and make them your pen-pal. Once your written English has improved, you could consider getting an English-speaking pen-pal!

    //Your pen pal could be someone who is learning English like you, or they may be a native English speaker who wants to practice their foreign language skills by writing to you in your native language.
    //Having a pen pal from an English-speaking country (such as the United States, Britain, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, for example) will also let you learn more about the culture and what life is like there. Stay motivated. When learning any new language, it is important to stay motivated and never give up.

    //Remind yourself of all the good things about being fluent in English.
    //You will be able to talk with English speakers from around the world and make new and exciting relationships, you will be able to engage with English-speaking culture like never before and maybe improve your job when you are fluent in English. Practice every day. If you want to be fluent quickly, you need to practice every day.

    //Learning a new language is based on repetition, so if you wait too long between study, you will forget everything you learned and have to start all over again, wasting time.
    //However, you shouldn't study so much that you get bored of English -- try to keep things fun by doing a different thing each day - one day of reading, one day of listening, one day of writing practice, one day of studying grammar, etc.
    //However, you should never skip an opportunity to practice speaking English, as this is the most important thing you should do to be fluent. Think in English. One way to go from being very good at English to being fluent is to actually think in English.

    //Dont translate from English into your native language and from your native language into English
    //As a result, your English will sound more natural to native speakers and you will speak more fluently. Make friends with English speakers.
    //This way, you will have to speak English if you want to talk to your friends. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Mistakes actually help you improve.

    //Everyone makes mistakes, it’s normal.
    //When learning English, you aren’t trying to be perfect. Even native English speakers don’t have perfect English.

    //Article: How to Write a Diary
    //Content: Write about the events of your day. Think about everything that happened that day and record any highlights or feelings that stand out to you. Even if you had a pretty standard day, you might be surprised by deeper thoughts and feelings that come up as you write down details about your day.

    //Feel free to veer off into any topic you want as you're writing about the day's events.
    //For example, you could write about the English exam you took at school that day. Are you feeling good about the exam? Do you wish you had studied more? Are you nervous to receive your grade? Contemplate your goals for the future and how to achieve them. Make a list of your short-term and long-term goals. Then, go through each item on the list and write in detail about your plan to accomplish the goal. Breaking each goal up into smaller tasks that you can work on can make your goals feel less overwhelming.

    //For example, you could write about short-term goals like studying for your algebra exam or hitting the gym for a cardio session.

    //Long-term goals would be stuff like choosing and applying to colleges or saving up money to buy a car. Jot down your current feelings or mood. Don't worry about providing any context for your emotions, just focus on accurately describing what they are. You can then use those feelings and thoughts as prompts for creating detailed diary entries. Work on one thought or emotion at a time and explore it as fully as you can.

    //For example, if you're feeling sad, you can write a diary entry about why you feel that way and any events that may have contributed.
    //You can add a line from the lyrics of a song you are often listening to in your entry to preserve the current mood. Write down inspirational quotes and what they mean to you. Inspirational quotes can come from anywhere—a famous person, your favorite book or movie, or even a friend or a family member. Any quote you find inspiring is a great starting point. Record the quote in your diary and note where it came from. Then, explain what it means to you in your own words.
    //For example, you might write down a quote like, "The secret of getting ahead is getting started," which came from Mark Twain. Write a diary entry about what this means to you and what things you need to get started on to achieve certain goals. Explore your favorite subjects or hobbies in-depth. Make a list of topics that you love or your favorite hobbies. You might love movies, sports, food, travel, art, or fashion. The subjects can be anything you want, as long as they interest and inspire you. Then, choose one item from the list and create a diary entry about it.

    //For example, if you love sports, write about why you love a certain sport, your favorite teams, and personal goals you have if you play any sports yourself.
    //If you love painting, you could write about your favorite painters, the painting styles that speak to you the most, recent paintings you've made, and ideas for future paintings. Write the date in the corner or on the first line. You may not write in your diary every day, so dating your entries can help you keep track of when things happened. Since you'll be writing in your diary over a long period of time, dates will also help you stay organized and provide context when you look back on your entries in the future.
    //If you like, you can also put the time, day of the week, and your location alongside the date. Begin each entry with a topic in mind. Most people reach for their diary when they have something they want to get down on paper or think about. This could be anything—something that happened that day, a dream you had, future plans, an event, an idea, or strong emotion or mood you're feeling.
    //Once you start writing, you're free to veer off into any subject you like! But having something in mind when you start the entry can help kickstart the writing process. Open with "Dear Diary" if you want to. This is a completely personal choice, so go with what works best and feels right for you. At first, addressing the "Diary" can feel almost like reaching out to a friend rather than simply writing or talking to yourself. You may find this helpful if you're new to journaling. Write in the first person by using "I" statements. Diaries are very personal items, and they typically work best when you speak in the first person. In your diary, you are free to make everything about you! Many people find this aspect extremely cathartic, especially when it comes to exploring personal thoughts, emotions, and reactions.
    //For example, you might write something like, "I'm worried about volleyball tryouts this week. I've practiced a lot and I feel ready, but I'm so nervous I can hardly eat." Be honest in your entries. Many people find diary writing cathartic because they can let go of inhibitions on the page and truly be themselves. Feel free to record your emotions, both positive and negative, in their entirety in your diary. Remember that no one will ever see what you've written, so you can write honestly about anything. This is for your eyes only.

    //For example, you might write, "I feel jealous of Shaun's new car. I'm happy for him, but it seems really unfair that his parents bought him a brand new car. I'm working every day after school just to save up for a used car."
    //If you're afraid someone will find and read your diary, there are things you can do to prevent this. Physical diaries with locks and password-protected digital diaries are two of the most popular ways to control privacy.
    //Many people have epiphanies about themselves and their relationships through honest diary writing. Be open to learning about yourself as you write. Don't worry too much about grammar and spelling. Your diary is a safe space for you to vent and share without the pressures of external judgment. Write freely and without inhibition. Being grammatically correct, proper spelling, and writing perfect phrases are not nearly as important as getting your thoughts and feelings down on the page. Jot down the first things that come to mind when considering your day, current mood, and any feelings you're struggling with.
    //For some people, it helps to take a few minutes at the beginning of each entry to simply free write. Use lots of details to preserve moments in time. Diaries help you preserve thoughts and feelings as they're happening. You're also able to record events immediately after they happen when details are still fresh in your mind. Since memories can become unreliable, especially as time passes, recording precise details vividly can help you preserve moments in time exactly as they occurred.
    //Detailed writing isn't for everyone, so don't feel like you have to write long, wordy sentences. If you find it easier to express your emotions in short bursts or even bullet points, feel free to do that. Choose a specific time each day to write in your diary. Many people struggle to find the time to write in their diary. Others simply forget to write. It helps to choose a specific time each day for diary writing so that you can develop the habit. Eventually, it will become second nature, but it can help to set a daily reminder on your phone until then!

    //For example, you might choose to write in your diary every night right before bed.
    //Don't set an unrealistic schedule for yourself. If writing every day seems out of reach, plan on writing entry 3 times a week instead. Keep your writing sessions short in the beginning. You don't have to set aside a huge chunk of time every day for writing in your diary! 10-15 minutes per session is a great goal when you're just starting out. Jot down your most pressing and immediate feelings and thoughts. You can always write more later in the week when you have time!

    //For example, you could write a few key bullet points in your diary when you're pressed for time.
    //Setting an intimidating schedule for yourself could be counterproductive. You want journaling to be an outlet, not a chore, so go easy on yourself.
    //Pick a time to write when you don't have other obligations or time constraints. Use illustrations if you prefer drawing to writing. Some people find if easier to convey their thoughts and emotions through drawing rather than writing. If you're more likely to stick to a schedule when drawing or sketching is involved, feel free to use that approach!
    //Quick drawings may also help you get down something that you want to remember but don't have time to write about.

    //Article: Safely Clean a Laptop Screen Using Household Products
    //Content: Turn the computer off and unplug the power adapter and battery. Cleaning a screen that's in use can result in permanent damage, so be on the safe side of things and turn everything off. Don't just put it to sleep!
    //If your laptop has an internal battery, you don’t need to unplug the battery. Get a microfiber cloth. This is made with a type of fabric that doesn't produce lint, in addition to being very soft — both important qualities for cleaning a laptop. If you use a washcloth, T-shirt or another type of cloth, it could leave extra debris on your screen or scratch it.

    //Avoid using paper products as well. Never use a napkin, paper towel, toilet paper or another paper product, since these are scratchy and will damage the screen.
    //A microfiber cloth is handy for cleaning all sorts of screens and lenses.

    //Note: If your computer screen has nano-texture glass (such as some iMacs), you’ll need a special cleaning cloth instead of a microfiber cloth. Wipe the screen gently with the cloth. Using one sweep of the cloth should take care of any dust and loose particles on the screen. Wipe gently without exerting much pressure, since if you press too hard you could damage the screen.

    //When you wipe with gentle circular motion, you'll be able to lift up some of the tougher spots.
    //Never scrub the screen, or you could cause pixel burnout.

    //Cleaning with compressed air is also a great, safe way to remove dust from your laptop. Clean the laptop frame with a gentle cleaning solution. If the area around the screen is dirty, you can use a standard household cleaning solution and a paper towel; just be very careful not to let it touch the screen.

    //If you want to do an even more thorough cleaning, check out how to clean the inside of your laptop and clean your keyboard.
    //If your laptop has been overheating lately, try cleaning its fans. Turn the computer off and unplug the power adapter and battery. Since you're using a liquid to clean the screen in this method, it's important to turn off the computer and unplug it from the power source.
    //If your laptop has an internal battery, you don’t need to unplug the battery. Create a gentle cleaning solution. The ideal solution is plain distilled water, which contains no chemicals and is gentle on the screen. If heavier cleaning is needed, a 50/50 mix of white vinegar and distilled water can also be effective.

    //Make sure you use plain white vinegar, not apple cider vinegar or any other kind.
    //Distilled water is better than tap water because the salts and minerals have been removed.
    //Manufacturers no longer recommend using any cleaners with alcohol, ammonia, or any strong solvents on LCD screens. Put the solution in a small atomizer bottle. This is the type of spray bottle that you push from the top to get a fine mist, similar to a perfume bottle. Pour some of the solution into the spray bottle and screw on the top.

    //Don't spray the solution directly onto the screen.
    //You can use a funnel to pour the solution into the bottle. Apply a minimal amount of the solution to a microfiber cloth. A static-free, fiber-free cloth works best. Remember not to use regular cloth, since this could scratch the screen. Do not soak the cloth; you just want to get it moist, which is the purpose of using the atomizer bottle to wet it.

    //A wet cloth can drip or run when cleaning the screen and the solution can go behind the bezel, permanently damaging your screen.
    //Try applying the solution to just one corner of the cloth at a time, to make sure you don't get it too wet. 1 to 3 sprays should be enough. Wipe the cloth against the screen in a circular motion. Rapid circular movements generally eliminate streaks and grime. Apply a gentle and even pressure to the cloth. Use only enough pressure to keep the cloth in contact with the screen. Take care not to press your fingers into the cloth or screen, since applying too much force when cleaning the screen can permanently damage the LCD matrix and render your screen unusable.

    //Hold the screen toward the very top or very bottom to avoid re-smudging it as you work.
    //You may need to pass over the screen multiple times before all the smudges have been removed. You may also need to re-dampen the cloth as you work, depending on how many passes over the screen you need to make.
    //If you notice dripping liquid on the screen, there is too much solution on the cloth. Use a dry microfiber cloth to dab away the excess solution on the screen to avoid damaging it. Never directly wet the screen. Do not, under any circumstance, spray water directly onto the screen of the laptop. This significantly increases your odds of getting water into the machine, thereby making a short more likely. Only use water if you apply it with a soft cloth.
    //Do not drench the cloth in water. A soaked cloth is more likely to drip excess water into the machine, which could cause serious damage to your computer. If you accidentally use too much water, wring the cloth out well until it is only slightly moist. Do not use regular cleaning supplies on your screen. The only cleaners safe for your screen are the light water and vinegar mixture or a special store-bought cleaner meant for LCD screens. Do not use the following:

    //Window cleaner
    //All-purpose cleaner
    //Dish soap, or soap of any kind Never scrub your screen. If you press too hard you can permanently damage your laptop. Use a gentle circular rubbing motion when you clean your screen. Avoid using a brush or anything but a very soft cloth to clean your screen. Use a microfiber laptop keyboard cover. Dirt and oil can transfer from your fingers to your keyboard, then to your screen. You can use a microfiber laptop keyboard cover to protect your screen.

    //Make sure to use a keyboard cover made for laptops (preferably for your specific model). Microfiber cloths that are too thick could damage the screen while the laptop is closed.
    //You can also consider using an external keyboard instead of the laptop keyboard to keep the screen cleaner for longer. Keep your laptop away from dust. Closing your laptop when you’re not using it goes a long way in preventing dust from building up on the screen.

    //Article: How to Calculate Percentages
    //Content: Put the two values into a fraction. The smaller part goes on top of the fraction (numerator), and the value of the whole goes on the bottom (denominator). For instance, let's say we have a jar containing 1199 red marbles and 485 blue marbles, making it 1684 marbles in total. If we’re looking to find the percentage of blue marbles, that is our “part.” The “whole” is the total number of marbles (1684). Therefore the fraction is 485/1684 (part/whole).
    //When you're setting up two proportions, it's easiest to set them both up as the part over the whole on either side of the equation. Convert the fraction into a decimal. Percentages are best calculated from the decimal form. For the marbles example, to turn 485/1684 into a decimal, divide 485 by 1684 using a calculator or pencil and paper. This comes to 0.288. Convert the decimal into a percent. Multiply the result obtained in the step above by 100. For the marbles example, 0.288 multiplied by 100 equals 28.8%. Bonus Example 1: Jerry, an electrician, worked 7 months out of the year. What percent of the year did he work?

    //There are 12 months total in a year, so Jerry worked 7/12 months.
    //Then, convert the fraction to a decimal: 7/12 = 0.58
    //Next, convert the fraction to a percent: 0.58 x 100% = 58%
    //Jerry the electrician worked 58% of the year. Bonus Example 2: Donovan took a math test and got 35 correct and 10 incorrect answers. What was the percentage of correct answers?

    //35 correct answers + 10 incorrect answers = 45 answers total
    //We can set this problem up as the fraction 35/45.
    //35/45 = 0.78
    //0.78 x 100 = 78%
    //Donovan got 78% of the answers correct on his test. Use this method when you’re given a percentage and a “whole.” Set the numbers you’re given into the percent formula P/100 = Part/Whole. Say you borrowed money from a friend who is going to charge you daily interest. The amount borrowed was initially $15 and the interest rate is 3% per day. Then, 3% would be P in the formula, and $15 would be the “whole” amount. Plug the numbers into the formula to get 3/100 = X/15.
    //Remember, part over whole equals part over whole. Convert the percentage into a decimal. Divide the percentage by 100%, or you can multiply by 0.01 (they’re the exact same).  3%/100% = 3/100 = 0.03. You’d be left with 0.03=X/15.
    //You can translate any percentage into a decimal by dividing by 100. For example, 26% = 26/100 = .26 Cross multiply to solve for X. It helps to reword your problem with the new value(s) now in the form of “X of Y is Z.” X is the decimal form of your percent, “of” means to multiply, Y is the whole amount, and Z is the answer. So, 0.03 x $15 is $0.45.

    //In this example, $0.45 is the amount of interest accrued each day that you do not pay your friend back.
    //If you need to further calculate the total due after 1 day, you would add the amount you borrowed to the amount of the interest times the number of days. So $15 + ($0.45 x 1 day) = $15.45. Bonus Example 1: A baseball pitcher won 80% of the games he pitched. If he pitched 35 ballgames, how many games did he win?

    //We can reword this problem as “What is 80% of 35?”
    //Plug the values into the formula P/100 = Part/Whole
    //80/100 = X/35
    //0.8 = X/35
    //35 x 0.8 = X
    //X = 28
    //The pitcher won 28 games. Bonus Example 2: A metal bar weighs 8.15 ounces. 93% of the bar is silver. How many ounces of silver are in the bar?

    //We can reword this problem as “What is 93% of 8.15?”
    //Plug the values into the formula P/100 = Part/Whole
    //93/100 = X/8.15
    //0.93 = X/8.15
    //0.93 x 8.15 = X
    //X = 7.58
    //There are 7.58 ounces of silver. Use this method to solve for a missing “whole” when you’re given a percentage and a “part.” Set the numbers you’re given into the percent formula P/100 = Part/Whole, which we can write as P/100 = X/Y. For example, imagine you’re given the problem “45% of what number is 12?” Plug the numbers into the equation like this: 45/100 = 12/Y.
    //A shortcut: notice you can manipulate the percent equation to get this formula below.

    //Part/Percent (in decimal form) = Whole
    //Keep reading for a full walk-through if you’re not sure how to get there. Convert the percentage into a decimal. Divide the percentage by 100, or just move the decimal place over 2 places to the left.  45%/100% = 45/100 = 0.45. You’ll end up with 0.45 = 12/Y. Cross multiply to move Y into the numerator. That means you’ll move from 0.45 = 12/Y to 0.45 x Y = 12. Now you can solve for your missing variable Y. In your head, you can reword this to “45 percent of Y is 12.” Remember “of” means "multiply." Divide the part by the percentage (in decimal form) to get your answer. For the main example, solve for Y by dividing both sides by 0.45. You’ll get Y = 12/0.45, which equals 26.67. For these types of problems, check your work by making sure that the answer is bigger than the original part you were given. Check out these additional examples below.

    //Bonus Example 1: This year, Acme Computers made approximately 72% of its sales online. There were 1,380 online purchases. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, how many total sales did Acme Computers make this year?

    //Plug the values into the formula P/100 = Part/Whole
    //72/100 = 1,380 online sales/Y total sales
    //72/100 = 1,380/Y
    //0.72 = 1,380/Y
    //0.72 x Y = 1,380
    //1,380/0.72 = Y
    //Y = 1916.66
    //Acme Computers made 1917 total sales this year.


    //Bonus Example 2: 39% of what number is 89?

    //Plug the values into the formula P/100 = Part/Whole
    //39/100 = 89/Y
    //0.39 = 89/Y
    //0.39 x Y = 89
    //89/0.39 = Y
    //Y = 228.2 Subtract the original amount from the new, bigger amount. Imagine your small company makes $44,000 in one year. The next year, you make $49,750. To start calculating the percent change in revenue, find the difference between $49,750 and $44,000: $49,750 - $44,000 = $5,750. You’ll treat $5,750 as the “part” of the “whole” (which is your original number). Divide the difference of the numbers by the original amount. You might recognize this as the first step in a basic percentage calculation–you’re setting up a fraction with the “part” over the “whole.” For the small business example, divide $5,750 by $44,000: $5,750 / $44,000 = 0.13. Multiply the decimal by 100% to get the percentage. You could also move the decimal place over twice to the right–it’s the same thing! In this case, we’d have 0.13 x 100% = 13%. Bonus Example 1: A game cost $13.99 last month, but this month it costs $15.75. Calculate the percent increase of the price.

    //New Amount - Original Amount = Difference
    //$15.75 - $13.99 = $1.76
    //(Difference / Original Amount) x 100% = Percent Increase
    //($1.76 / $13.99) x 100% = 12.5%
    //The price of the game went up by 12.5%. Bonus Example 2: A sweater company buys sweaters from a factory for $22. Then, they put their brand on the sweaters and sell them for $55. What’s the percentage of their markup (the difference in cost)?

    //New Amount - Original Amount = Difference
    //$55 - $22 = $33
    //(Difference / Original Amount) x 100% = Percent Increase
    //($33 / $55) x 100% = 60%
    //The company has a 60% markup on sweaters. Subtract the new amount from the original, bigger amount. For example, imagine you’re looking to invest in the stock market. A certain stock sold at $67 per share in one month. Now, the price has dropped to $52 per share. Subtract $52 from $67: $67 - $52 = $15. That $15 difference is the "part" of the "whole" ($67). Divide the difference by the original amount. This is the basic percentage calculation–you’re essentially putting the “part” over the “whole” in fraction form. For the stock example, divide $67 by $15: $15 / $67 = 0.22. Multiply the decimal by 100% to get the percentage. For a quick way to do this, move the decimal place over twice to the right. In this case, we’d have 0.22 x 100% = 22%. Bonus Example 1: Jane worked 42 hours a week in April. In May, she worked 39 hours a week. What was the percent change in her hours between the two months?

    //Original Amount - New Amount = Difference
    //42 - 39 = 3
    //(Difference / Original Amount) x 100% = Percent Increase
    //(3 / 42) x 100% = 7%
    //Jane’s hours decreased by 7%. Bonus Example 2: Company A starts out with 563 employees. After layoffs, they’re left with 542 employees. What’s the percent change in the number of employees?

    //Original Amount - New Amount = Difference
    //563 - 542 = 21
    //(Difference / Original Amount) x 100% = Percent Increase
    //(21 / 563) x 100% = 3.7%
    //Company A decreased their number of employees by 3.7%. Calculate a restaurant tip in your head. You can calculate restaurant tips with tricks that involve moving the decimal place over for the total cost of your bill. Here are quick strategies to work out tip percentages without a calculator:

    //Calculating a 10% tip: Simply move the decimal place over once to the left.
    //Example: If your bill is $54, a 10% tip would be $5.4.

    //Calculating a 15% tip: Find 10% by moving the decimal place over to the left. Then, divide that number in half to get 5% of the bill. Then, add the 10% and 5% values together.
    //Example: For a $54 bill, 10% is $5.4. Half of $5.4 is $2.7. Finally, $5.4 + $2.7 = $8.1.

    //Calculating a 20% tip: Double the total bill, then move the decimal place over once to the left.
    //Example: For a $54 bill, double that is $108. If you move the decimal one place to the left, you'll get $10.80. Calculate your savings from a price discount. Write down the original price and the discount percentage. Then, subtract the discount percentage from 100. For instance, if you want to buy a shirt that’s 30% off, 100% - 30% is 70%. That means you’ll pay 70% of the original price. Now you’re ready to walk through this easy calculation:

    //Move the decimal two places to the left. In this example, 70%/100% = 70/100 = 7/10 = 0.7.

    //Multiply the original price by the new decimal. If the shirt you want is $20, multiply $20 by 0.7. This comes to $14, meaning the shirt is now on sale for $14.

    //Calculate your savings. Simply subtract the sale price from the original price ($20 - $14 = $6 saved)! Calculate the total cost with sales tax. To calculate the cost of an item plus tax, start by converting the sales tax to a decimal. Next, add that number to 1 (think of 1 as 100% of the cost of the original item). For example, if sales tax is 8%, you’d do 0.08 + 1 = 1.08. Then, multiply the price of your item by 1.08. If your item costs $20, the item plus 8% tax would be $20 x 1.08, which equals $21.6.
    //Bonus Example: Mark is buying a sweater that costs $15. Sales tax is 9%. How much will he pay at checkout?

    //Convert 9% to a decimal: 0.09
    //Add the decimal to 1: 0.09 + 1 = 1.09
    //Multiple that value by the original price: $15 x 1.09 = $16.35
    //Mark will pay $16.35 at checkout.

    //Article: How to Force Yourself to Seriously Study
    //Content: Keep a list of the reasons why you need or want to study. Whatever your reasons are, write them down on a piece of paper and keep them somewhere you can see them often. When you feel like skipping out on studying, read them over to remind yourself of why you need to work hard.
    //Reasons to study can range from wanting to get good grades so you can get into a good college to keeping a scholarship to simply not getting in trouble for getting bad grades. No reason is too big or too small to add to your list! Make boring information more interesting so it’s easier to study. Ask yourself, “How does this material relate to my life?” or “How can I use this in my life?” For example, if you’re bored by the book you have to read for English class, ask yourself how you can relate to the characters in the book to keep yourself engaged. Or, if you’re struggling with studying for biology, get interested in how much you can learn about your yourself and all the living things around you.
    //It can be difficult to be interested in everything, and some subjects just won’t captivate you. But, try your best to figure out how everything you’re learning can apply to your own life. That personal connection could spark enough interest to keep you going! Set a timer so that you know there is an end in sight. Nobody wants to study for hours on end without a stopping point. Give yourself frequent, regular breaks during your study time. You could set an end time for the day, too, so that you know at the latest how long you’ll be studying.

    //For your actual study blocks, set a timer for 30-50 minutes and then take a timed break before getting back to work. You’ll study more efficiently if you know a timer will be going off soon.
    //If you study right after school, you could commit to working until dinner time but then give yourself the rest of the evening off. Or, if you study at night, set a timer for 30 minutes before your bedtime so you can wind down. Reward yourself at the end of each study block to keep yourself going. This can be something really small, like getting to enjoy a piece of your favorite candy at the end of each block of time, getting to check Twitter or Instagram for 5 minutes, or taking a break to cuddle your pet.
    //You could also plan a fun reward for the end of each exam to celebrate all your hard work! Getting coffee with friends, taking a long bath, buying something you’ve had your eye on—make it something that you love to do so it feels more meaningful once you’ve taken a test. Enlist the help of a study-buddy. This doesn’t have to mean you actually sit down and study together. Rather, this is a person you can check in with every day to help keep you on track. If you know you have to text someone at the end of the day to tell them if you hit your goals, it could help you stay motivated to study when you don’t feel like it.
    //You could ask your study buddy to check in with you if they haven’t heard from you in a few days. This could get you back on track with your plans before too much time passes. Study at the same time every day so it becomes a habit. If you’re a morning person, consider waking up before school to get in some study time. If you’re a night owl, committing a few hours every evening might work best. Or, if you like to get things done so you can move on to more enjoyable tasks, you may want to commit to studying as soon as you get home from school every day.
    //If you don’t already, try using a|daily planner. You can use the calendar app on your phone or get a physical planner to write in. Schedule in your study time each day so that you remember to not book anything else for that time. Make a schedule for exams so you can start studying ahead of time. As soon as you learn about a test, write it down in your calendar. If your teacher gave you a schedule at the beginning of the semester, take some time to input all the important due dates and exam dates into your planner.

    //For example, if you know you have a Spanish test next Friday and an Algebra test the following Wednesday, you’ll know that you need to study for Spanish first.
    //It can even be helpful to write in reminders for the weeks before a test to start studying! For example, if you have a big English test coming up in 3 weeks and you want 2 weeks to study the material, put in a reminder to start studying ahead of time. Break down the material you need to learn into small sections. To avoid getting overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of what you need to do, break down the information into small, bite-sized pieces. Write down what each piece consists of so you know what you need to tackle when you sit down to study.

    //For example, if your Chemistry test is going to cover 5 chapters and vocabulary words, your smaller sections could be made up of reading a chapter at a time and making vocab cards. 
    //Concentrate on getting 1 step done during each study block. When you’re done, put a checkmark next to it so you can track your progress. This will help you feel more motivated and in control of your study sessions. Schedule time to rest and relax. It isn’t realistic to expect yourself to be able to study for 5 hours straight—your brain will need a break! You may need to take a short 5-10 minute break every 30 minutes. If you can go a little longer, try studying for 50 minutes before taking a 10-minute break. When you do take a break, stand up, walk around, get some fresh air, get a snack, or simply rest your eyes for a few minutes.
    //On a bigger scale, you may need to schedule a few “rest days” for yourself during exam season. If you know you’ll be studying hard for a few weeks, set aside a day where you will free yourself from all studying obligations completely. This will be something to look forward to! Have a healthy snack and drink some water before studying so you can focus. Hunger and thirst can be huge distractions when you sit down to study. Avoid eating sugary foods so that you don’t crash later on. If you’re going to drink caffeine, try to limit yourself to 1-2 cups of coffee or a single soda so that you don’t get jittery.
    //Vegetables, fruits, nuts, cheese, popcorn, yogurt, and hummus are great snacks to choose from. Boost your concentration by taking a quick walk before you study. Work out some nervous energy and boost your endorphins with a 10-15 minute exercise session. When you sit down to study afterward, it’ll be easier for you to focus and retain what you’re studying. Go someplace where you won’t be distracted by your surroundings. If you’ll be tempted to clean your bedroom or if you live in a noisy space, you may need to find a new study location. Similarly, if you want to study with your friends but find you can’t without getting distracted, you may need to set up some boundaries so that you can concentrate.
    //In general, a space that is clear of sights and sounds that will distract you is going to be the best for studying. Turn off all of your electronics that you don’t need for studying. Or, if you need to use your phone for a timer, turn it onto airplane mode so notifications won’t come through. Don’t have the TV on in the background, and put your phone away somewhere you won’t be tempted to look at it, like in a separate room.
    //There are also some great apps out there that you can use to help limit how much time you spend on your phone. Some can even block access to specific sites during designated times. Do whatever works best for you, whether that’s getting offline altogether or setting up a few restrictions. Be selective about whether or not you’ll listen to music while you study. For some people, music is a huge distraction. But for others, some gentle background music can help them concentrate. Try studying with and without background music to see which way works best for you.

    //If you’re studying in a public place, playing some light music through your headphones can help you tune out everything else that is going on around you.
    //In general, instrumental music is the best for concentration. Set a timer for 10 minutes and get started! It may seem simple, but just starting is often the biggest hurdle to taking your studying seriously. Set a timer and commit to working on the task at hand. Once the timer goes off, set it for another 15-20 minutes before taking your first break. Once you get started, it’ll be easier to continue.
    //Even if you feel behind or like you should have been studying for weeks already, don’t panic. Starting now is better than not starting at all!
